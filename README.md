I'm **Akram** — a quiet builder from **Bangladesh**.
Started writing code in **2013** and somehow it never stopped.

I build products, contribute to open source, and focus on turning ideas into things people can actually use.

**Tech I’m fluent in:**
`**PHP · Golang · Rust · JavaScript · AI/ML**` — plus the usual `modern tools` that make software fast, scalable and worth shipping.

I’m an **entrepreneur who codes** — not just for the love of programming, but for creating something meaningful.
